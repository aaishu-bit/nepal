<p style="font-size:20px; text-align=center;"> <i><u> Nepal is located in South Asia and shares territorial borders with India and China with an area of 147,181 square kilometers and a population of approximately 30 million. Kathmandu is the nation"s capital and the country"s largest metropolitan city.<br> Previously ruled supposed to be the holiest Hindu temple in the world. Not only for the Hindus but also for the Buddhists Nepal offers a unique -place of pilgrimage as it happens to be the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the apostle of peace and compassion.

 <br>Nepal is a place of festivals with some part of the kingdom or the other celebrating some festival during everyday of the year.<br> Festivals may be linked with the remembrance of the departed soul, to herald the different seasons, to mark the beginning or end of the agricultural cycle, to mark the national events, or just family celebrations. On a festive day the Nepalese take their ritual bath, worship different gods and goddesses, visit temple, observe fasting and under feasting . </i></p></u>

<h3 style=" color:brown;text-align:center; "><u>NEPAL'S HISTORY</u></H3>
<P style="color:green;"> <i> <i><u>Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multiracial, multicultural, multi-religious, and multilingual country. The most spoken language is Nepali followed by several other ethnic languages.

<br> The modern day Kingdom of Nepal was established in 1768 and started a campaign of unifying what would form the modern territories of Nepal. Some former territories had been lost due to the Anglo-Nepalese War and the Sino-Nepalese War.<br> In the Sino-Nepalese war, the conflict ended with both victories and losses with the kingdom ultimately accepting tributary status with the Qing dynasty of China from 1792 to 1865.[1] The Anglo-Nepalese War ended in British victory and resulted in the ceding some Nepalese territory in the Treaty of Sugauli. <br>In a historical vote for the election of the constituent assembly, the Nepalese parliament voted to abolish the monarchy in June 2006. Nepal became a federal republic on 28 May 2008 and was formally renamed the 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' ending the 200-year-old reign of the Shah monarchs.

Toponymy
Nepal's origin remains a mystery despite written records dating back to the fifth century A.D. Classical Indian sources mention Nepal, and Nepali stories delve into mythology, religion, and culture rather than providing a clear historical account.[2]

The derivation of the word Nepal is a subject of various theories:

Most inhabitants of northern Nepal came from Tibet, where they herded sheep and produced wool. In Tibetan, ne means "wool" and pal means "house". Thus, Nepal is "house of wool".[3]
Newar people in the Kathmandu valley named their homeland Nepal, derived from "Nepa," meaning "country of the middle zone," highlighting its central location in the Himalayas.[3]
A popular theory is that Lepcha people associated Nepal with a "sacred or holy cave."[3]
According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne, referred to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi.
According to Buddhist legend, the deity Manjushri drained the water from Nagadaha (a mythical lake believed to have filled the Kathmandu Valley). The valley became habitable, ruled by Bhuktaman a cow-herder, who took advice from the sage named "Ne". Pāla means "protector" or "taking care", so Nepal reflected the name of the sage who took care of the place.[3][4]

A map of the Himalayan region annexed by Gorkha Kings around 1768 as per the book published in 1819 by Francis Hamilton M. D. named "An Account of the Kingdom of Nepal and the Territories annexed to this Dominion by the House of Gorkha".
Ancient history
Main article: Ancient history of Nepal</br>
Prehistory
 <br>Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[5] It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 3300 BCE) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans<Br> and long before Indo-Aryans from across the border.The Tibeto-Burman peoples were likely the earliest significant settlers in Nepal, especially in the highlands and hilly regions.The Indo-Aryans arrived later, contributing significantly to the cultural and linguistic framework of Nepal, especially in the Kathmandu <br>Valley and lowlands.The Dravidian presence in Nepal is minimal, as they primarily settled in the southern parts of India after Indo-Aryan expansion pushed them southward.[6] Tharus who were Tibeto-Burmans mixed heavily with Indigenous tibes in the southern regions, are natives of the central Madhesh Province and Terai region of Nepal.<br>[7] The first documented tribes in Nepal are the Kirat people is the record of Kirat Kings from Kirata Kingdom from 800 BCE, which shows Kirats were recorded in Nepal last 2000 to 2500 years, with an extensive dominion, possibly reaching at one time to the delta of the Ganges.[8] Other ethnic groups of Indo-Aryan origin later migrated to southern part of Nepal from Indo-Gangetic Plain of northern India.[9][10]

Emperor Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several significant structures in Nepal. <Br>These include the Ramagrama Stupa, Gotihawa Pillar of Ashoka, Nigali-Sagar Ashoka Pillar inscription, and the Lumbini pillar inscription of Ashoka.The Chinese pilgrims Fa-Hien (337 CE – c. 422 CE) and Xuanzang (602–664 CE) describe the Kanakamuni Stupa and the Asoka Pillar of currently Nepal region in their travel accounts. Xuanzang speaks of a lion capital atop the pillar, now lost. A base of a Pillar of Ashoka has been discovered at Gotihawa, a few miles from Nigali Sagar, and it has been suggested that it is the original base of the Nigalar Sagar pillar fragments.[11] In 249 BCE, Emperor Asoka founded Lalitapatan city of Nepal.[12][13]</u></br><b></i></p>

<i><u> major festival</u></i>
<ul type =" circle">
<li>dashain</li>
<img src="d.jpg">
<P style ="color:purple;"> <i>Dashain, also known as Vijaya Dashami, is the greatest and most widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal. It typically falls in September or October (depending on the lunar Bikram Sambat calendar) and lasts 15 days. Dashain is much more than a festival.

It brings Nepalis in Nepal and abroad together and provides a sense of unity. For this reason, the importance of Dashain has gone up at a time when disunity and fractured relations have become much more common. In addition to Nepal, Hindus in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh celebrate Dashain. 
Dashain
 celebrates the victory of good over evil.<br> It brings people together as they enjoy the niceties of life.

As the people visit the temples and perform rituals, they acknowledge a higher benevolent god that looks over the mortals to foster a liveable society. The festival also provides Nepalis time to think over the spiritual side of life. 

 <br>Dashain concludes with the elders putting a tika on the forehead of the younger counterparts. This very act reminds the young people to respect their elders. It also teaches the newer generation to continue the Dashain traditions.

Dashain transcends or mitigates the social, economic, and caste boundaries. People from all walks of life come together to celebrate. It promotes social harmony and unity within communities.

<br>Dashain also offers an opportunity for cultural exchange as visitors can witness and participate in the festivities, gaining a deeper understanding of Nepalese culture.

Religious History of Dashain Festival
We cannot be sure of the exact reason for celebrating the Dashain festival. There are various legends associated with the Dashain Festival. Here are two of the most prominent ones.</i><br></p><hr>

<p style="color:red;"> <b><u>1.Goddess Durga</b></u></p>
  <p><br>The oldest legend concrning dashain relates  to durga,a mythicsl character mentioned in Vedas, including Rigveda. Etymologically,<br> Dur means “remote/difficult” ga means “pass-through” and together, Durga means “the inaccessible” or “the invincible”.

<br>Durga is also mentioned in two popular Hindu scriptures - Mahabharat and Ramayan. However, the names appear to have different contexts.<br> Interestingly, though Dashain is mostly about Durga, other deities, particularly Laxmi, are also involved.<br> Durga is invoked with 108 names. Manuscripts dating back to the 14th century have guidelines on how to perform Durga puja.<br> 

Durga is a warrior goddess who rides a tiger and remains armed with the weapons of male gods.<br> She has many hands and holds weapons like a bow, arrow, sword, conch, chakra, javelin, trident, shield and noose. <br>These Durga depictions were quite common in the 4th century. Interestingly, Durga or Durga-like goddesses have also featured in Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.</br></p>
<hr>

 <p style="color:blue;"><b><u>2. King Rama</u></p>
<br>  Another significant story associated with Dashain is the Ramayana. Ramayana states that in Treta Yug, Rama (also regarded as the avatar of lord Vhisnu) killed Ravana, who had abducted his wife, Sita.<br> Rama is supposed to have invoked the blessings of Durga during this war and defeated Ravana on Dashami.<br> Even today, Hindus erect and burn the effigies of Ravana and other demons to mark this holy day.<br>

 

Important Days during Dashain Festival in Nepal
Dashain is celebrated for fifteen days and the tenth is the most important. Here are the most significant days.<br>
<hr>

<p style="color:white;"><b><u>3.Ghatasthapana: the first day</u></p>


<br>Dashain begins with Ghatasthapana, which means placing a Kalasha (a traditional pot) that symbolizes the goddess Durga. This is the day when the Jamara (seedlings) are planted inside a room. The seeds used are barley, maize, paddy, etc. The Jamara is worshipped for nine days and used for worship on the tenth day.<br>
<hr> 

 

 <p style="color:purple;"><br> <b><u>4.Phulpati: the seventh day</u></p>


 <br>Phulpati is made of two words - Phul means flower, and Pati means plants. On this day, devotees worship Durga by offering nine types of flowers and plants. Such a worship is supposed to take care of the health and prosperity of devotees.  Nationally, at the Dashainghar in Hanuman Dhoka, Kathmandu, Fulpati from Nuwakot is transferred. The Nepali army forms a special parade in front of VIP delegates.<br>
<hr>

 

<p style="color:brown;"><br> <b><u>5.Maha Asthami: eighth day</u></p>
<br>This is the eighth day of Dashain, where devotees try to appease the bloodthirsty Kali by offering her animal sacrifices of buffaloes, goats, hens, and ducks. The animal sacrifice is also carried out on Kathmandu Durbar Square and Nepal's presidential palace premises. Later in the day, there is a huge feast. The ethnic Newars observe “Khadka Puja” by worshiping their weapons on this day.<br>
<hr>

 

<p style= "color:green;"> <b><u>6.Maha Navani: ninth day</u></p>
<br>Maha Navani is the last day of Navaratri, celebrated with extensive animal sacrifice. The Nepal Armed Forces perform animal sacrifices and fire a 21-gun salute. This is also the day when artisans, traders, and mechanics offer animal sacrifices while worshipping their tools, equipment, and vehicles. It is the only day the Taleju Temple in Hanuman Dhoka is open for public worship.<br>
<hr> 

 

<p style="color:red;"> <br><b><u>7.Bijaya Dashami: the tenth day</u></P>


<br>This is the biggest day of the Dashain festival, which cumulates with putting tika (a mixture of vermillion, curd, rice) on the foreheads of youngers. The Jamara shown in Fulpati is also placed on the heads of the tika receivers. Further, the elders give small amounts of money as Dakshina to the youngsters after putting on the tika and blessing them. The tika is offered for five more days (until the full moon day).<br>
<hr>

 

<p style="color:orange;"><br> <b><u>8.Kojagrat Purnima: the fifteenth (last) day</u></p>
 <br>Kojagrat means “who is awake”. On this day, followers worship Goddess Laxmi (goddess of wealth and prosperity). Hindus believe that on this night, Laxmi descends to earth to shower wealth to those awake during the night. 
<hr>
<p style="color:purple;"><br><i> <u>TIHAR </u></i></p>
<img src="t.jpg"  width=600 height=600">

<p><br><u>Tihar (also known as Yamapanchak Deepawali) is a five-day spiritual and cultural Hindu festival of lights celebrated by Nepalese as well as by the Indian Gorkhas inhabiting Sikkim <br>state and Territories (particularly the towns of Darjeeling and Kalimpong). Tihar is analogous to the Indian festival of Diwali, the festival of lights, but both are different Festivals.

<br>Tihar is referred to as Yamapanchak Tihar in Kathmandu Valley by Newari Nepalis and Dipawali Tihar in Madhesh Province by Madhesi Nepalis. In the rest of Nepal and the Indian states of Sikkim<br> and Gorkhaland, both Nepalis and Indian Gorkhas refer to Diwali as the Tihar Parwa.

Like Diwali, it is marked by lighting diyo inside and outside the home, but unlike Diwali in other parts of India, the<br> five days of Tihar include celebration and worship of the four creatures associated with the God of death Yama, with the final day<br> reserved for people themselves.[1] According to the Vikram Samvat calendar, the festival begins with Kaag (crow) Tihar on Trayodashi tithi of Kārtika kṛṣṇa pakṣa (the 13th day of the waning moon) and ends with Bhai Tika on Dwitiya tithi<br> of Kārtika śukla pakṣa every year.[2] In the Gregorian calendar, the festival falls sometime between October and November every year.[3]<br></u>
<hr>

<p style="color:red;"><br><b><u>Celebration</u></p>
<br><u>Nepal's various communities celebrate Tihar in different ways. The festival is popularly known as Swanti among the Newars and as Deepawali among Madhesis.[4] Nepalis also<br> make patterns on the floors of living rooms or courtyards using materials such as coloured rice, dry flour, coloured sand or flower petals, called Rangoli, as a sacred welcoming for the gods and goddesses, particularly Lakshmi.[5]<br> For five days, people decorate their homes, and light diyo, candles, electric string lights around the house in the evenings.<br> As Lakshmi puja falls on the new moon night, which is the darkest night of the lunar month, people light those diyo, candles.<br> etc to remove the darkness and bring the light to home to welcome the goddess Lakshmi (Goddess of wealth).<br>

Firecrackers are often set off during the festival, although the Nepal government has placed a ban on the<br> use of firecrackers in recent years citing increasing cases of injury.[6]<br>

<br>Children also go from house to house to play Deusi/Bhailo (singing songs and asking for gifts in the form of money and foodstuff.)[1]

Gambling in the form of cards, kauda (a game of cowrie shells), or langur burja are popular pastimes during the festival.[7]<br>

<br>Tihar is the second biggest Nepali festival after Dashain, and is usually allocated a three-day-long national holiday.<br> The festival is considered novel in that it shows reverence to not just the gods, but also to animals such as crows, cows, and dogs that have long-lived alongside humans.<br></u>
<hr>

<p style="color:blue;"><br><b><u>Kaag Tihar (Day 1)</u></p>
<br><u>The first day of Tihar is called Kaag (crow) Tihar.[8] Crows and ravens, believed to be the messengers of the death god Yama, are worshipped with offerings of grains, seeds, and sweets placed on<br> the roofs or out on the streets.[9] The cawing of crows and ravens is associated with sadness and grief in Hinduism as these birds are believed to carry messages from Yama.<br> By feeding the crows, devotees hope to appease them and ward off death and grief for the coming year.[2]<br>

<br>Alongside Kaag Tihar, Dhanteras (also known as Dhan Trayodashi and Dhanwantari Jayanti) is also observed on this day.[10] Dhanvantari, the Hindu god of medicine is revered on this day.<br> There is also a tradition of people buying jewelries, utensils and home appliances on this day. It is considered auspicious to buy gold or silver on this day.[11]<br></ul>
<hr>
<p style="color:green"><br><b><u>kukur tihar(day2)
Main article: Kukur Tihar</u></b><br></p>

<br><u>A dog after being venerated during the Kukur Tihar festival in Nepal.
The second day is called Kukur Tihar,[12] on which people practice puja.[13] On this day, all dogs, whether pets or strays, are offered treats and worshipped by placing a tika on their forehead and garlands of marigolds around their necks. This day celebrates the special relationship between humans and dogs. At the gates of Svarga, Yudhishthira refuses to enter without the dog, who reveals himself to be the god Yama.[14] Thus, the ancient bond between man and dog is established in the Mahabharata.[15]

<br>As mentioned in the Mahabharata, Bhairava, a fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva, had a dog as a vahana (vehicle). Yama, the god of death, is believed to own two guard dogs – each with four eyes. <br>The dogs are said to watch over the gates of Naraka, the Hindu concept of Hell.[16] Owing to this belief, this day is also observed as Naraka Chaturdashi.[17]<br>

<br>Kukur Tihar has since acquired widespread popularity on the internet[citation needed] and in 2016, was even adopted by a Mexican animal rights group for a similar celebration in Mexico City.[18]<br></u>
<hr>

<p style ="color:purple;"><u>Gai Tihar and Lakshmi Puja (Day 3)
Main article: Lakshmi Puja</u></p>

<p style="color:orange"><u>A Nepali couple worships a cow.</u></p>
<br>The morning of the third day is called Gai (cow) Tihar. The cow is an especially important animal in Hinduism and is considered sacred. There is a belief, Mahalakshmi's presence<br> in the anus of cow or excretory products (Gobar and Gomutra) of it. Hindus revere the cow as a particularly docile animal that gives a lot more than it takes. The cow produces milk, cheese, ghee, urine and dung.[19] While the first three can be eaten, the urine is believed to have beneficial health effects[20][21]<br> and the dung is burned as fuel or used as fertilizer.[22] Thus, on the third day of Tihar, Nepali Hindus people show their gratitude to the cow by feeding them treats and worshipping them with tikas and garlands.[citation needed][23]<br>
<hr>

<b><u>Woman lighting a diyo</u><b><br>
<br>A woman lighting a diyo while surrounded by electric lights
The third day is also considered the most important day of the Tihar festival. Lakshmi, the patron goddess of the festival, is welcomed into<br> homes that have been cleaned and the doorways and windows decorated with garlands made out of marigolds. Diyos are put up all around the home, especially<br> in doorways and windowsills, while electric lights are draped over houses in the belief that the goddess will not visit dark homes.[1][24] A special puja is offered to Lakshmi in the evening, wishing for wealth, prosperity and good health.<br>

<br>In the evening, young girls go around the neighbourhood, singing and dancing in a tradition called bhailo.[25] They are offered small amounts of money and food as rewards for the entertainment they provide. Fireworks are also common on this particular day.[26]
<hr>


<p style ="color:white;"><u>Cow dung during Gobardhan Pujā<u></p>
Govardhan Puja and Mha Puja (Day 4)
Main article: Mha Puja
The fourth day of Tihar is known as Goru Puja, where the ox is worshipped and celebrated. The ox is seen as an analogue to the cow in Hinduism, as the ox provides manual labour, especially important for an agricultural country like Nepal.[27]<br> Vaishnav Hindus also perform Govardhan Puja, which is worship towards the holy Govardhan mountain. A pile of cow dung is taken as representative of the mountain and worshipped.[28]<br>

<br>The fourth day of Tihar also generally coincides with the first day of the Nepal Sambat calendar and thus, it is the celebratory Mha Puja for the Newar community, Mha Puja is a unique tradition where the self and the soul within is worshipped.[29]<br>
<hr>

<p style="color:brown;"><u>Bhai Tika (Day 5)</u></p>
<br>The fifth and last day of Tihar is called Bhai Tika. On this final day, which is celebrated with much fanfare across the country, brothers<br> and sisters mark their special bond by worshipping each other with giving gifts to each other to express their feelings.[30]

<br>The legend goes that when the goddess Yamuna's brother fell mortally ill, Yama the god of death came to take his soul. <br>Yamuna pleaded with the death god to wait until she had finished her final puja for her brother. She then embarked on a long elaborate ceremony that grew to include Yama.<br> The Yamuna then asked Yama to not take away her brother until the tika on his forehead had faded, the oil she had sprinkled on him had dried and the Makhamali Ful Ko Mala (Gomphrena globosa) garlands she had put around his neck had wilted.[31][32][verify]

<br>Thus, on the fifth day of Tihar, sisters create a protective barrier of holy water and blessed oil around their brothers, circumambulating them several times. A special garland made<br> out of the makhamali flower (Gomphrena globosa) is placed around the brother's neck as this flower is known for its long life. <br>The tika placed on the forehead of the brother is also unique in that it consists of seven different colours.<br> The tika is also placed on the sister's forehead by the brother.[33]<br>

<br>The ceremony is performed regardless of whether the brother is older or younger than the sister and first or second cousins are also eligible for the ceremony. In the end, the brother<br> touches the <br>feet of their sisters with their forehead, signifying love, respect and devotion. The brothers receive a variety of cooked food such as sel roti, fruits and packaged<br> food while the sisters receive cash or other gifts such as clothing.[34]
